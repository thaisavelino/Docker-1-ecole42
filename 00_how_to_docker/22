# 22. Turn Aiur into a slave of the local swarm in which Char is leader (the
# command to take control of Aiur is not requested).

## to connect your new node
#docker-machine ssh Aiur

docker-machine ssh Aiur "docker swarm join --token $(docker swarm join-token worker -q) $(docker-machine ip Char):2377"

## token is the key that authorizes you to join that swarm was given before but
## you can run this command to capture this $(docker swarm join-token worker -q)
## 2377 is the port to manage docker swarm
## where -q â€” Is to only display token.
# Then we must say the manager IP and the port.. this command shows the IP from Char wich is our manager $(docker-machine ip Char)


### Add worker to this swarm we could run
#docker swarm join \
#--token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
#192.168.99.100:2377
# *** this IP and Port was shown in the command before
